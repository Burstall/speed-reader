# Privacy Policy — Speed Reader Extension

**Last updated:** 2026-02-01

## Data Collection

This extension does **not** collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.

## What the extension accesses

- **Current tab URL and title** — Used to detect whether you are on your Speed Reader app or on an article page. This data is not sent anywhere except to your own Speed Reader app instance when you click the extension button.
- **Page content** — When you click "Read in Speed Reader", the extension extracts article text from the current page. This text is passed directly to your Speed Reader app via the browser URL. It is never sent to any third-party server.
- **Cookies from premium news sites** — When you click the extension on a supported premium site (e.g., Financial Times, Substack), cookies are read and sent directly to your own Speed Reader app instance so it can access paywalled content on your behalf. Cookies are never sent to any third party.

## Local storage

The extension stores your Speed Reader app URL locally in your browser using Chrome's `storage.local` API. This data never leaves your device.

## Third parties

This extension does not use analytics, telemetry, crash reporting, or any third-party services. No data is shared with the extension developer or any other party.
